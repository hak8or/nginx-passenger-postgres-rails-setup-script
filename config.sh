#		Add in a lock to what version of Phusion to use.
# DOES NOT WORK IN 14.04 YET! Packages required for passenger in 14.04 do not exist yet.

# Set up NGINX server on a port besides 80, for some reason something else is running on 80 and overrides all my
# changes to nginx.conf

# Passenger as default uses the older Ruby version (1.9.something) found in /usr/bin/ruby that ignores any gem
# stuff I do as the hak8or user, so the passanger-ruby-source needs to be changed to /usr/local/bin/ruby in nginx.conf

# Installing nodejs via apt-get as hak8or for the JS runtime does not seem to be seen by phusion, but manually adding
# gem "therubyracer", :require => 'v8' into the gemfile to use V8 JS interpreter works instead. Run bundle afterwards.
#  Therubyracer has issues on Heroku though, so I must try to find a way to use nodejs instead.

# This downloads ruby from source, installs rails, installs ngnix, and configures everything to work together.
